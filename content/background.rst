Previous state of affairs
------------------------
I use several different computational software I my research, each of which have a specific input and output format. This has lead to me having e.g. two separate scripts for calculating the same properties, where the only difference is the format of the input. This has been very inefficient because I've had to spend at least a couple of hours to modify my existing code and debug the new one, each time I switch software.

Sometimes I have worked for a longer time using just one computational program and in the process of the research project I've found that I needed to change coordinate system, atom notation or something similar. I have then added a step that does whatever change I needed in the code that I was using, thereby causing the scripts used with the other softwares to lag behind in functionality. Of course I have always planned to remedy this functionality, but as all of us know there is often something more pressing that comes in the way and these good intentions are postponed or even forgotten.

Another issue that I've had with my previous coding and code management practices was that I often saved copies of the same code at multiple locations. Say, I had been using the script in one folder, at a later point I had started a new project and created a new project folder, then I simply copied over the script to the new folder. This of course made it difficult to remember which one of the scripts I had used for which project.
